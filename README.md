# Server

## Goals

- Have multiple apps run on local server
- Server connects to openVPN on VPS (for static IP, dyndns does not work with my ISP)
- VPS exposes Server to internet
- Have all traffic SSL encrypted
- Traffic never gets decrypted on VPS, only on Server
- Have server accessible via domain.com
- Have each app accessible via sub.domain.com
